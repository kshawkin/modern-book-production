### Copy editing

The copy editor improves and fixes mistakes in style, grammar, and consistency.

Where a development editor works in broad strokes to improve the overall structure and flow of a manuscript, the copy editor works on finer details: sentence style, grammar, and consistency.

Sometimes, a project budget wonâ€™t cover both a development editor and a copy editor. In those cases, one person can try to fulfil both roles. This can be sufficient, although they are never as thorough as two separate people can be. Combining development and copy editing can also be a false economy: when an editor improves a manuscript at a high level, errors creep into the detail. These errors have to be found and fixed later in the process, when changes are more expensive to make.

Copy editors should work in good word-processing software. Real-time, collaborative software like Google Docs offers is best for version control, change tracking, and collaborative commenting. A single, online master document is critical. Offline Word or Excel documents are never used, because they have to be emailed and cannot be properly version controlled.
